# object_detection

In this repository, I do object detection on Kaggles data set [Open Images 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/c/open-images-2019-object-detection) using Inception-ResNet-v2. Inception-ResNet-v2 is a convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images. The network is 164 layers deep and can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, flowers, human, and many animals. As a result, the network has learned rich feature representations for a wide range of images.
